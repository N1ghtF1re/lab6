Lab â„–4. Working with one-dimensional arrays
--------------------
***
#### Task:
`Between N-points (N <= 50) there are given roads of length A [i,j], where i,j is the number of points. The roads are laid at different heights and intersect only in common points. At the initial moment of time from the given points begin to move with a constant speed M of robots (M = 2,3), independently changing the direction of motion only in points. Robots are controlled in such a way as to minimize the time until all robots meet in one place. The speed of the i-th robot can be equal to 1 or 2. The stop of robots is forbidden. Simultaneous travel of several robots along one road is prohibited.
Given the N and M and the network of roads of unit length (all available A [i,j] = 1), determine the minimum time through which all M robots can meet, with the initial position of the robots and the speed of their movement known. (If the meeting is impossible the program should issue a message).
